## simpy-demo

This demo simulates the process of communication between one client and one server, where the client sends a request to the server which sends back the corresponding response to the client. This demo is the baseline for C-S simulation. 

To run this demo, execute the following command: 

```bash
python evaluation.py
```

The output is shown below:
